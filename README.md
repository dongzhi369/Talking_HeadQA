Before running, you need to modify the file paths involved in lines 48 and 50 of the data_loader.py file and lines 73-79 of the train.py file. You also need to modify the GPU index used in the 4 line of train.py.  
The involved files can be obtained by running extract_frames.py, extract_SlowFast.py, and extract_audio_feature1.py. Due to the large size of the dataset and the long processing time, you can also directly download them using the provided links.The relevant files can be downloaded using the links provided below.    
The output.txt obtained from train.py needs to be sorted according to the video order specified in thqa_entire_testlist.txt located in paixu.py.
